                        &emsp; Let me start by saying that I thank God every day since I met you. Just as your name means, you're a blessing from god to me. I’ve said “I love you” a thousand times, but words could never fully show how much you mean to me. You are the most beautiful part of my life, and the love that I cherish more than anything. There hasn't been a single hour of the day where I haven't thought of you. You're the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last when I goto sleep, you're always on my mind.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  You’re special to me. You’re the only one who I wouldn’t mind losing sleep for, the only one I dont get tired of talking to and the only one that crosses my mind throughtout the day. You’re the only one who can make me smile without trying, bring my mood up without the intention to and affect my emotions with every action of yours. I can't explain with just words how much you mean to me, but you're the only one I'm afraid of losing and the one I want to keep in my life
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I know we have our ups and downs but that's what makes our bond stronger because we learn from eachother more. I want to hug, kiss, and cuddle with you but most importantly just to be with you. And I cant wait to get married and have kids with you. I love you Jassu. Even though I repeat these words, they will never be enough to explain how much you truly mean to me. You're my first love & girlfriend and I want you to be my last and become my wife. You're the love I never expected but now can’t live without.
